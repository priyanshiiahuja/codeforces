# Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I share solutions to various Codeforces problems. The solutions are organized by problem name and each file is named accordingly.

## Repository Structure

- Each file is named according to the problem name on Codeforces (e.g., `A_Beautiful_Matrix.cpp`).
- Solutions are written in C++ (or specify if other languages are used).
- Each file includes the problem name and a solution to that problem.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Problem Solution:**
Locate the file corresponding to the problem you are interested in (e.g., A_Beautiful_Matrix.cpp).

3. **Open the File:**
Review the solution provided in the .cpp file.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by:

- Adding solutions for other Codeforces problems.
- Improving or optimizing existing solutions.
- Adding explanations or comments to make the code more understandable.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are provided as a reference and may not be the most optimal. They are intended to help others learn and understand different approaches to solving problems on Codeforces.
